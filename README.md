**Pixel Runner** is a fun, fast-paced endless runner game built using **Python** and **Pygame**. Your goal is simple: avoid incoming obstacles, survive as long as you can, and earn the highest score possible.

With animated sprites, background music, and smooth jump mechanics, Pixel Runner is a great small game project demonstrating fundamental 2D game development concepts.
